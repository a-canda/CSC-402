Software Engineering Coding Assignments

Includes assignments 1-4 given throughout the semester. These are added to show the coding skills I've learned in this class. I encourage those that find these files to please not copy my work and try these problems on your own first.

Assignment 1: This assignment is to attempt to recreate the ASCII art with different SIZE constants.
