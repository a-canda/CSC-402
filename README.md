Software Engineering Coding Assignments

Includes assignments 1, 3 and 4 given throughout the semester. These are added to show the coding skills I've learned in this class. I encourage those that find these files to please not copy my work and try these problems on your own first. Your integrity and academic honesty is important for your own good.

Assignment 1 (A1): This assignment is to attempt to recreate the ASCII art with different SIZE constants. <br>
Assignment 3 (A3): This includes an introduction to a Visitor class. I added the final product of the Visitor Class and the "Original" files before the visitor class was implemented.
Assignment 4 (A4): This was a more complicated version of Assignment 3.
Final Assignment: Our final project was to implement a visitor class for a semantic analyzer (I did not include all files for this project, only the parts that I had to code for the project).
